This folder is an example of a FSM interacting with a datapath designed to
add two numbers with two phase clock contol.

All of the flip-flops are designed for negedge.

The total top project with the test_top.v testbench would require

vlib work

vlog test_top.v top_module.v main_FSM.v dp.v 

After the vlog, the last item compiled will be listed as top_module_tb from the test_top.v file.

vsim top_module_tb

The design will load two four bit values into registers in the datapath and add them.
Data in_d1_in and in_d2_in should yield
test case 1 at cycle 7, 3 + 1 = 4
test case 2 at cycle 12, 4 + 2 = 6

There is one test Verilog file to verify the FSMs and the dp.

There is pre and post synthesis Questa results. Also, Innovus and Magic files are
included. An Irsim command file and simulation are also included.
