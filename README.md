# Tetris Chip Project
Teammates: Prahalad Chari, Linsey Russ, Haibo Li
Goal is to make a chip that can play a modified game of tetris on a 8x4 grid (rows x columns).
The game pieces are a dot, square, line, and L. The player can move left, right, and rotate clockwise. There are no quickdrops or any other features.
